# exaile-test-files
Sample audio files and data useful for testing Exaile's features

## Contents

* left_channel.mp3 - Plays a beeping tone on only the left channel
  * Useful for testing the mono plugin
* noise_tone.ogg - Plays static for 10 seconds, tone for 10 seconds
  * Useful for testing gapless, start offset, resume on playback
  
The following tracks should not have an audible gap when played back to back:

* gapless_noise1.ogg
* gapless_noise2.ogg
* gapless_3.flac
* gapless_4.flac

The following don't seem to honor gapless, not sure why:

* gapless_broken1.ogg
* gapless_broken2.ogg

## Policies
* Only audio files with test data are allowed **no copywritten files allowed**
